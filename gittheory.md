## Here are some notes on Git Theory
1. SVN, Mercurial, Bazaar are other version control systems
2. Git is a distributed version control system
	- cloning is making a local copy of that code - check the history of the project
3. Staging area vs working directory vs repo
	WD - (uncompressed and complete version of the file) | like a factory | 
	Staging area (index file) | unique to git | like a loading dock | 
	repo (bare clone because they have no WD's)  - the git repository (all the content)
	<br>
.git folder is the git repo | after you git commit then the repo == WD
